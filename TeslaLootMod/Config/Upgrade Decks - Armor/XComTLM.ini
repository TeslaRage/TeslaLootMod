; Config entries for Armor Upgrades. This allows the upgrades introduced by the mod to be included into upgrade pool
; This creates new upgrade decks and configured to only be applicable to armors
; The basic premise of the decks are as follows:
; ArmorBaseDeck - basic vest upgrades
; ArmorUtilityDeck - utility upgrades
; ArmorRemoveME - sorta a hardcode, to always get SmartSlot module so we could dump another vest upgrade
; ArmorLegoDeck - a stronger vest upgrade, typically from mod added vests

; Which armor template to be selected is configured in Base Item Decks\XComTLM.ini
